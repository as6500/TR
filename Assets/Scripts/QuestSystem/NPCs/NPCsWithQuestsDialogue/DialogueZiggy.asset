  dialogueWithQuest:
  - These people keep messing with my work... Why did I accept this job??
  - Anyway, hello! I've called you here to my lab because I need to ask for a favor.
  - I'm too old to go outside and look for what I want, but you are young and still
    with many years to live.
  - 'My plan is now complete. I have developed a potion that can make the land outside
    of the Bunker fertille once again, however, 1 ingredient is missing: 2 vials
    of antibiotics.'
  - 'That''s where you come in: would you do me the favor of going to the City and
    finding the missing ingredient? It''s probably in one of the 3 stores on the
    left side of the City.'
