  dialogueWithQuest:
  - Not again.. the flickering lights are back. We really should fix the power in
    the bunker.
  - Well.. now is the best time to fix it..
  - Can you try to find any type of power source like some batteries so we can put
    it on the generator?
  - I believe that I saw a few old toys on the barn at the Farm, maybe they have
    what we need.
  dialogueFinishingQuest:
  - Aaaand the power is back! You are brave by going out there and saving others.
    As a reward, I'll give you 5 pills.
