  dialogueWithQuest:
  - Being a cop is not an easy task you know? You have to keep moving forward no
    matter what.
  - Now that the end of the world has come, I don't know what to do with my time.
    It used to be such a rush and now I just sit here drinking.
  - From being still for too long, my old injury has been hurting quite a lot and
    my pills are almost over.
  - Would you mind going to the City to see if there are any pills left in the stores?
    Otherwise, maybe the mutants already scavenge that and have the pills in them.
  dialogueFinishingQuest:
  - Thank you so much for getting these for me! To help you stay more protected,
    here are 20 bullets for your pistol. Use them wisely, as they are rare to find
    these days.
