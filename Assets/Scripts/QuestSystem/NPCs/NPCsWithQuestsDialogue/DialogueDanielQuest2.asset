  dialogueWithQuest:
  - Have you noticed that people here in the Bunker are getting sadder and sadder?
    I'm getting worried about them..
  - 'But I have an idea that it''s going to stay in everyone''s memory: let''s throw
    a party!'
  - We have the bar, the people, the lights.. the only thing that we are missing
    is MUSIC!
  - Before everything was destroyed and "swallowed" by radiation, there used to be
    a music store near a huge and beautiful park.
  - Do you have time to go check it out and see if there is still any record left?
    Any record of happy music is good to bring here again!
