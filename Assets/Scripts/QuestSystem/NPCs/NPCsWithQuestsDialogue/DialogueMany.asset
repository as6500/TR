  dialogueWithQuest:
  - A long time ago, when I worked as an engineer in one of those tall buildings
    with only windows, I hid a bottle of alcohol inside my office.
  - Please try to find its location so I can later go pick it up, because in these
    times... a bit of alcohol calms my soul.
  dialogueFinishingQuest:
  - 'I appreciate that you found it! Here is a little gift for the trouble: 5x pills
    and 10x bullets. Good luck with the other guys.. They are a little crazy sometimes.'
