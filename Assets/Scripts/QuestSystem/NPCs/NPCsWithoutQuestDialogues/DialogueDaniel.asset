  - The first partner that I had was really something, my first real friend.. Then
    he vanished from the earth... No, he didn't die, he just moved to the other side
    of the planet.
  - I once was shot in my pinky finger and it didn't bleed, how strange is that?
  - I wish I didn't eat that burrito at lunch..
