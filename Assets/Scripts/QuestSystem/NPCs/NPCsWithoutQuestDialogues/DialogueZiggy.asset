  dialogue:
  - If you mix clorophorme and ether it creates a kind of anesthesia! It was used
    by american military doctors on the battlefield! How awesome is that?
  - People call me insane but you know what? I'm quite mad by nature, and it's my
    craziness that has saved me from extinction.
  - Please try not to eat to many bananas.. They are delicious but if you ate too
    much of them.. you get radioactive!
