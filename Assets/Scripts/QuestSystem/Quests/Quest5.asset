  descriptionOfQuest: 'These people keep messing with my work... Why did I accept
    this job??  Anyway, hello! I''ve called you here to my lab because I need to
    ask for a favor.  I''m too old to go outside and look for what I want, but you
    are young and still with many years to live.  My plan is now complete. I have
    developed a potion that can make the land outside of the Bunker fertille once
    again, however, 1 ingredient is missing: 2 vials of antibiotics.  That''s where
    you come in: would you do me the favor of going to the City and finding the missing
    ingredient? It''s probably in one of the 3 stores on the left side of the City.'
