  descriptionOfQuest: "Have you noticed that people here in the Bunker are getting
    sadder and sadder? I'm getting worried about them.. We haven\u2019t eaten anything
    good for a while. Just by thinking about one of those scrumptious stakes it makes
    me salivate Before everything was destroyed and \"swallowed\" by radiation, there
    used to be a supermarket near a huge and beautiful park. Do you have time to
    go check it out and see if there is still any good food left? Any type of food
    that doesn\u2019t have mold in it would be amazing!"
