  descriptionOfQuest: Not again.. the flickering lights are back. We really should
    fix the power in the bunker.  Well.. now is the best time to fix it..  Can you
    try to find any type of power source like some batteries so we can put it on
    the generator?  I believe that I saw a few old toys on the barn at the Farm,
    maybe they have what we need.
