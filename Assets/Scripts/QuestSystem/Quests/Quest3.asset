  descriptionOfQuest: Being a cop is not an easy task you know? You have to keep
    moving forward no matter what.  Now that the end of the world has come, I don't
    know what to do with my time. It used to be such a rush and now I just sit here
    drinking.  From being still for too long, my old injury has been hurting quite
    a lot and my pills are almost over.  Would you mind going to the City to see
    if there are any pills left in the stores? Otherwise, maybe the mutants already
    scavenge that and have the pills in them.
